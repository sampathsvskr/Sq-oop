# Sqoop - SQL to Hadoop

-Data injestion tool.<br>
-Mainly used for importing data from relational databases to HDFS and vice versa.<br>
-Sqoop works based on Map-Reduce framework and works in parallel with multiple mappers at a time.<br>
-uses only mappers as it is just a transfer of data and as any aggregations are not performed over that data during sqoop import/export.<br>

[Sqoop mostly used commands<br>](https://github.com/sampathsvskr/Sq-oop/blob/main/Sqoop%20Commands)
